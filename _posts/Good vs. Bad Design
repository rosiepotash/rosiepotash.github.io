The Amazon Echo Alexa is a very good design. This voice activated piece of technology can work well in any room of the house and serves a variety of purposes. You can listen to music, check the weather, and set a timer. These tasks may seem very simplistic, but it can cut down your phone usage in a noticeable way. For example, many people choose to set up their Echo in their kitchen or living room to be able to access information without having to pull up their phone while their hands might be dirty. The simplicity of the Amazon Alexa Echo Dot is also very pleasant, when the Echo Dot detects the word “Alexa” it will light up, which is very straightforward.

Push doors with handles are generally a very bad design. These types of doors are less than Human centered. The designers of these doors did consider human intuition. When a human reads push, they will push. When a human sees this kind of handle, they think to pull. If a person is walking and they do not read “push” they are very likely to pull the door. It causes a minor inconvenience but is a noticeable defect.
