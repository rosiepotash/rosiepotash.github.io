During my fly on the lab research I noticed a notable disconnect between high schoolers and middle schoolers. I noticed several instances where high schoolers would become angry with middle schoolers. Some of the things high schoolers would become frustrated with middle schoolers about include: sandwich line behavior, behavior in the hallways, and volume on the bus. Each of these problems include instances of middle schoolers behaving in a manner that is undesirable to high schoolers. The core problem in these situations is that a lot of times, middle schoolers do not know that what they are doing is annoying. The disconnect between the middle and high schoolers has caused a significant amount of consequential problems. The middle schoolers are not yet aware of social norms that high schoolers have acclimated to. This topic connects directly to community engagement because of the lack thereof. The fact that middle and high schoolers spend such little stress-free time together is a complete lack of community engagement. The high schoolers get angry at the middle schoolers about something they very well might not be aware of. This causes a difficult cycle of disconnect and annoyance between the two groups. Fixing this problem would help to solve a gap in the way the two groups engage with each other.
