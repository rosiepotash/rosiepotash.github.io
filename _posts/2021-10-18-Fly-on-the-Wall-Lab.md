For the FOTW lab, I went out around the campus in order to observe the school environments and interactions that took place. Because it was not a lunch period, it was challenging to observe people and their interactions with the environment. During one of my lunch periods, I observed the interactions between students and the cafeteria space. I noticed that it was consistently crowded. The cafeteria lines were incredibly long and many people chose to exit the sandwich line because it was taking too much of their time. The school administration seemed to try to fix this extreme line by using a guiding rope, an attempt at organizing the line, therefore making it go faster. Through my observation, it made no difference in the length or waiting time for a sandwich. Another thing I noted while in the cafeteria was the interaction between students and the tables and chairs. The tables were very close to each other and people in chairs were very close to other tables. Due to this lack of space, many people choose to eat in places other than the cafeteria. Me and my partner, Sari, tried our best to remain a “fly on the wall” and note observations rather than problems. This was challenging because our initial instinct was to note problems and think of how they potentially could be solved.
